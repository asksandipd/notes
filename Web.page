flash RTFMP

- udp only (RTMP is the tcp-based one)
- can make p2p connections using RTFMP server (eg adobe stratus) as rendezvous
- server maintains list of potential peers that can be connected to
  - server assigns temp uniq IDs to connections from SWFs
  - other SWFs connected to server can subscribe to streams and events from
    that ID once the bcasting SWF agrees to the connection
  - if NetConnection to server is lost/closed, any peer connection is also
    closed
- server also assists in nat-t; supports TURN
- in flash 10; see NetConection, NetStream objects
- security
  - privacy: 128-bit AES encryption; key negotiated with D-H
  - auth: none, but provides secure nonces to aid with app-level auth
  - only enables sending media from mic/cam to other flash player endpoints
    that subscribe to media streams
