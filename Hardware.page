- native command queueing (NCQ): a SATA tech that allows HD to internally
  reorder operations
  - also used in SSDs but for a reverse purpose: because the SSDs experience
    latency in the CPU; this allows for a batch of operations to be issued
  - obsoletes PATA tagged command queueing (TCQ), which was CPU intensive
