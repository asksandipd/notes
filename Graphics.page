Basics

- bitblt: perform boolean operation on same-sized rectangles in two images
  (src, dst)
- Bresenham's algorithm: line-drawing
- triangulation
  - subdividing surfaces is useful for many things
  - Delaunay triangulation: maximizes angles; yields most-equilateral triangles

Definitions

- texel: pixel in a texture

"Post-processing" techniques

- anti-aliasing: techniques include hyper sampling, subdividing pixels, random sampling, ...
  - "2X AA" means supersample at twice the display resolution
- texture filtering: blend texels for smoothing, eg when scaling/misaligned
  - cheap approx to anti-aliasing
  - betterness: anisotropic > trilinear > bilinear > nearest-neighbor with mipmapping > nearest-neighbor
    - bilinear: blur pixels
    - trilinear: blur mipmaps
    - anisotropic: make mipmaps of diff ratios
- mipmapping: technique to save some filtering
  - when minifying textures, may need to combine many texels
  - so, prefilter at smaller sizes

GPU programming

- pixel shaders, cuda are examples of things that compile to gpu bytecode
  - before gpgpu langs, devs had to pack data into triangles/textures
- langs
  - opencl: cross-platform
  - cuda: nvidia only
  - Cg: NVIDIA high-level shading language (HLSL)
  - D3D11 "compute shaders": platform-indep HLSL
  - CUDA: GPGPU PL
- pixel shaders: typically for effects; eg solar flares
- gpu bytecode is card-indep; cards from same mfr can have different ISAs
- gpu instrs are very SIMD; slow branches; produces machine code

CUDA

- gives you 'threads'
- but real way to get any speedup is to have all threads executing same instr at same time (simd)
- gpu's have very predictable cycle counts
- up to dev to keep threads in step

OpenGL

- opengl has a mode where you can disable the perspective frustum
  - useful for 2D games; TODO why single 3D plane insufficient?
- textures, triangles reside in video mem
- textures are mapped/interpolated onto surfaces
- use 4D linear transformations for non-linear xforms in 3D (eg translations)

OpenGL Software

- GLU: OpenGL Utility Library
- GLUT: OpenGL Utility Toolkit; unmaintained, restrictive license
- freeglut: OSS clone of the original GLUT
- openglut: fork of freeglut that adds some more functionality
- SDL: takes care of opengl init
- GLUI: OpenGL User Interface Library

Windows Graphics APIs

- user32.dll does all window/menu/etc. drawing on top of GDI
- Graphics Device Interface (GDI): old Windows API for drawing lines/curves,
  rendering fonts, handling palettes
  - can't animate: no synchronizing framebuffers
  - can't rasterize for 3D
  - no direct app-HW access but higher abstraction; easy to draw on multiple
    devices
  - GDI+: C++-based; anti-aliasing; FP coords; gradient shading; more complex
    path mgmt; intrinsic file format (jgp/gif) support; affine xforms of 2D
    view pipeline
- desktop window manager (DWM): compositing engine added in vista
  - runs on D3D
  - runs GDI, GDI+; GDI no longer HW-accel'd; GDI now software-rendered legacy
  - GDI: apps paint to system memory surface; copied to video memory surface in
    DX pixel fmt on compositor's schedule
  - DX: call `Present()` when done
- Direct3D: basically the GPU API ("immediate mode graphics API")
  - fills in holes that HW is missing with software
- Direct2D: added in Win7; to render geometries, bmps, text directly atop D3D
  - less capabilities than gdi and wpf
  - also: remote rendering over RDP; SW fallback for server-side rendering/lack
    of HW; cleartype
  - native api and .net wrapper
- DirectWrite: complements D2D; HW-accel'd text; text layout/rendering;
  typography; works with any other drawing api
- handle can be passed to various GDI functions
- WPF: aka avalon; .net api; uses milcore.dll (dx)
  - xaml tree sent to wpf rendering thread; app then sends tree updates
- old gdi: paint directly to drawn buffer
- compositing window mgr: paint to own buffer; DWM composes these
  - redraw elsewhere/in other ways
  - tear-free experience (dx "flip")
  - no re-draw's to background apps (window trails, blank spaces)
  - windows are drawn as textures; borderglass blur done via pixel shaders
  - not .net but like wpf in using milcore.dll (dx)
- WDDM: new dx driver model in vista
  - virtualizes video mem: backed by main mem, then disk
  - allows interruptibility of GPU
  - allows dx surfaces to be shared across processes

DirectX

- final `Present()` call draws

Graphics architecture (Angstrom group meeting, jrk@mit.edu, 4/24/08)

- raytracing vs rasterization
  - rasterization is best suit for doing primary visibility (calculating what's
    visible)
  - raytracing good for calculating scene lighting?
- IO bandwidth: 50% texture input, 50% read-modify-write framebuffer,
  negligible scene input
- arbitrarily large amt of computation: color on each pixel, anti-aliasing
- most money in game production goes into art
  - artists mostly work with photos and Photoshop
  - cost doubles every 2-3 years
  - much more expensive than hardware
  - no/very little procedural content generation
  - programmers more expensive than artists, and more effort to produce
    content-generating algos
  - exceptions: Spore
- graphics pipelines: how long are they?
  - "Graphics Pipeline": directx and what points where you get to insert your
    functions and what are fixed
  - easily come up with 100 pipeline stages for parallelism
- (geometry, textures) -> many vertex -> 1 rasterization -> many fragmentation
  -> some framebuffer
- general-purpose data-parallel cores for graphics (Intel's architecture) is the future
- locality easy to achieve
- NVIDIA CUDA lets you program more generally for GPUs
  - used to bend over backwards by reducing problem to triangles and quads
  - similar to Cell
  - DX11 has general-purposes shader
- Cell is painful
- abstract model: asynchronous dataflow with kernels and queues
- paper on same stuff from Sequoia folks
