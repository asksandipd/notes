Graphics architecture (Angstrom group meeting, jrk@mit.edu, 4/24/08)

- raytracing vs rasterization
  - rasterization is best suit for doing primary visibility (calculating what's
    visible)
  - raytracing good for calculating scene lighting?
- IO bandwidth: 50% texture input, 50% read-modify-write framebuffer,
  negligible scene input
- arbitrarily large amt of computation: color on each pixel, anti-aliasing
- most money in game production goes into art
  - artists mostly work with photos and Photoshop
  - cost doubles every 2-3 years
  - much more expensive than hardware
  - no/very little procedural content generation
  - programmers more expensive than artists, and more effort to produce
    content-generating algos
  - exceptions: Spore
- graphics pipelines: how long are they?
  - "Graphics Pipeline": directx and what points where you get to insert your
    functions and what are fixed
  - easily come up with 100 pipeline stages for parallelism
- (geometry, textures) -> many vertex -> 1 rasterization -> many fragmentation
  -> some framebuffer
- general-purpose data-parallel cores for graphics (Intel's architecture) is the future
- locality easy to achieve
- NVIDIA CUDA lets you program more generally for GPUs
  - used to bend over backwards by reducing problem to triangles and quads
  - similar to Cell
  - DX11 has general-purposes shader
- Cell is painful
- abstract model: asynchronous dataflow with kernels and queues
- paper on same stuff from Sequoia folks
