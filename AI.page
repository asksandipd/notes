Developing a self-driving car for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge (Seth Teller's
Angstrom talk, 5/1/08)

- 40 compute cores
- many other teams performed human-assisted map annotation
- Seth's team focused on going almost entirely from sensing
- many other teams used much fewer cores
- uses of sensing
  - using vision for finding paint
  - using active sensing for depth
- stereo algos: reconstruct 3D from cameras
  - recent stereo algos have a global component that is harder to parallelize
- optical flow: estimating motion across time
- groups
  - planning & control: how to stay on the white dotted lines; one technical
    focus
  - perception: another technical focus
  - working on the car
  - software infrastructure: codebase, OS, etc.
- power-bound
  - also CPU-bound in the sense that they could process rawer images, at higher
    rates, etc.
  - also IO-bound; had 2 GigE and a CAN, all mostly utilized
- Anant: near future will yield cameras that have encoders
  - Seth: these are not as useful for vision research
  - algos need to know gradients, for instance; what does MPEG do to gradients?
- looked at GPUs
  - programming models still painful
  - form factor limits (1U blades)
- didn't want DSPs either because they didn't know what algos they ultimately
  wanted; everything was exploratory
- Anant: suggest fifth team, on computation resources

MACHINE LEARNING

- variables
  - visibility
    - _hidden variables_, _latent variables_, _model parameters_, _hypothetical variables_
    - _observable variables_, _manifest variables_
  - causality
    - _independent variable_, _predictor variable_, _regressor_, _controlled variable_, _manipulated variable_, _explanatory variable_
    - _dependent variable_, _response variable_, _regressand_, _measured variable_, _responding variable_, _explained variable_, _outcome variable_
