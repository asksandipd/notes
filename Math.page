- graph theory: a branch of combinatorics
  - eulerian circuit iff all nodes have even degrees
  - eulerian non-circuit tour iff only 2 nodes have odd degrees

statistical learning
====================

- kernel density estimator: basically place a small kernel everywhere you have
  a sample, resulting in somtehing much smoother than a histogram (where bins
  can make all the difference in interpretation)

statistics
==========

- TODO
- (paired) student t-test
- distributions
  - student t-distribution: something about normals for small populations where
    variance is unknown
  - chi-square distribution

combinatorics
=============

- permutations without replacement: P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!
- permutations with replacement: n^r
- combinations without replacement (partitioning sets): C(n,k) = n! / (k! (n-k)!)
  - this is the _binomial coefficient_
  - _multinomial coefficient_: partitioning into multiple sets
    - binomial is actually C(n; k, n-k)
    - C(n; k1, k2, ..., kp) = n! / (k1! k2! ... kp!)
- combinations with replacement (multisets/bags):
  C(n-1 + k; n-1, k) = (n-1+k)! / (k! (n-1)!)
  - proof using "stars and bars"

mathematics
===========

- abstract algebra: study of algebraic structures such as groups, rings,
  fields, modules, vector spaces, and algebras
- topology: extension of geometry that focuses on structure
- algebraic topology: uses abstract algebra
- graph theory
- topological graph theory: topology + graph theory; studies embeddings of
  graphs in surfaces
- number theory
- computational number theory, algorithmic number theory: applications in
  crypto

geometry

  - easy proof

Interesting questions that came up during ICFPC08

- find the tangent lines (up to four) between a pair of circles
  - find the tangent lines between a circle and a point
- if we roll a circle around the outside of an ellipse and trace the path of
  its center, is the resulting oval an ellipse?

linear algebra
==============

From <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix>:

> Conceptually, sparsity corresponds to systems which are loosely coupled.
> Consider a line of balls connected by springs from one to the next; this is a
> sparse system. By contrast, if the same line of balls had springs connecting
> every ball to every other ball, the system would be represented by a dense
> matrix. The concept of sparsity is useful in combinatorics and application
> areas such as network theory, of a low density of significant data or
> connections.

symmetric positive definite, positive semi-definite, negative definite, indefinite, etc.

- $M$ is _positive definite_ iff any of:
  - $z^T M z > 0$ for all nonzero vector $z$
  - all evals of $M$ are pos
  - all leading principle minors are pos
    - i.e. upper left $k \times k$ submatrix of $M$ has pos det for all $k =
      1,2,\dots,n$
    - eg: if $M$ is diagonal, then $M$ is pos def iff all diag elts are pos
      (diag elts are evals)
- $M$ is neg def iff any of:
  - $-M$ is pos def, i.e. $x^T M x < 0$ for all nonzero vector $x$
  - all evals of $M$ are neg
  - upper left $1 \times 1$ submatrix has pos det, upper left $2 \times 2$
    submatrix has neg det, upper left $3 \times 3$ submatrix has pos det, etc.
- $M$ is pos semi-def iff any of:
  - $z^T M z \ge 0$ for all vector $z$ (usual definition)
  - all evals of $M$ are non-neg
  - note: if $M$ is pos semi-def, then all upper left $k \times k$ submatrices
    have non-neg dets, but this is not a sufficient condition any more; same
    for neg semi-def below
- $M$ is neg semi-def iff any of:
  - $z^T M z \le 0$ for all vector $z$ (usual definition)
  - all evals of $M$ are non-pos
  $M$ is indef iff any of:
    - $M$ is neither pos semi-def nor neg semi-def
    - $M$ has pos and neg evals

cryptography
============

RSA (TODO REVIEW!)

- choose primes p, q
  - primality testing: _wheel factorization_ is certain; there are also
    probabilistic tests
- find $e$ such that $gcd(e, (p-1)(q-1)) = 1$
  - i.e., find $a$ such that $ae + b(p-1)(q-1) = 1$. This is a _diophantine
    equation_ and can be solved using the _Euclidian algorithm_.
- exponentiation: find $M^e \mod n$
  - $M$ is data, $e$ is pub key, $n$ is priv key
  - _square and multiply algorithm_
  - _Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)_ for more complex, faster algos

  - Pearson's product-moment coefficient: most popular

    $$\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{ \cov(X,Y) }{ \sigma_X \sigma_Y }$$

- keithw: slides
- entropy coding
- arithmetic coding can get us flatter?
