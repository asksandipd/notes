academia

- assistant professor: 5-6 years, then tenure/promote to associate
- associate professor
- (full) professor

standard bodies

- ecma: they submit things to iso
- iso/iec: big kahuna
- ietf: internet standards, rfcs; works with w3c, iso
- w3c: web standards; works with iso
- whatwg: w3c too slow; made html5; w3c agreed to adopt
- iana: IP addrs, AS numbers, media types, IP protos/ports/etc; runs dns root
  and some TLDs; op'd by icann
- icann: iana stuff, TLDs, root servers

- theory folks seem to use single-column articles, probably because math
  lines grow long (as I encountered in my machine learning report) and
  because their articles tend to be much shorter (and thus probably require
  fewer compacting/space-saving measures)

Charles Babbage: first programmer

Ada Lovelace: publisher of first program (Babbage's)

game programming

- heavy emphasis on performance all the way through
  - unlike web app dev, where you just need to make things scalable
  - still use asm, esp. for graphics operations

demoscene

- ultra-compact interactive graphical programs, usu. in asm

MusicBrainz

- used to use a patented technology called TMR but that didn't turn out to be
  scalable (lots of collisions among dissimilar tracks)
- switched to MusicIP analysis technology, also closed-source
- Picard tagger has much lighter-weight "fingerprinting" technology

games
=====

- engines
  - cube
    - games: assaultcube
  - cube 2/sauerbraten: in-game level editing
    - games: blood frontier (last release 2/2009)
  - id tech 1: 1993; opened 1997, GPL'd 1999
    - games: doom, doom 2, hexen, heretic
    - BSP
  - quake engine: 1996; GPL'd xmas 1999; maps GPL'd 2006 (but not other
    content, eg textures)
    - games: quake, quakeworld
    - BSP
    - gouraud shading for moving objs
    - lightmap for static objs
    - quakec scripting lang; future id engines used c then c++
  - id tech 2: 1997; GPL'd xmas 2001
    - games: quake 2
    - BSP
    - opengl
    - MD2 model fmt: 10 keyframes/s
    - lightmap levels using radiosity
    - used DLLs to switch btwn opengl/SW, to release certain srcs to allow
      modding, and to replace the dynamic lang quakec
  - id tech 3: 1999; GPL'd 2005
    - games: q3a, urban terror (proprietary)
    - BSP
    - levels can use either lightmaps or gouraud shading; engine could apply
      lightgrid lights to models
    - MD3 model fmt: use vertex movements (vs skeletal anim); variable
      keyframes/s; separate head/torso/leg parts for indep animations
    - blob shadows and accurate polygonal shadow
    - HLSL
    - volumetric fog
  - ioquake3: cleaned-up id tech 3
    - games: openarena, tremulous
  - darkplaces (heavily modified quake 1 engine); best gfx
    - games: nexuiz
  - id tech 4: 200
    - games: doom 3, quake 4, ET:QW
    - C++
    - entirely dynamic per-pixel lighting, vs. lightmaps and gourard shading
      - dynamic effects previously available only changed polygon vertex
        brightness and interpolated pixel colors
    - bump mapping, normal mapping, specular highlighting
    - more features added in successive games
    - later feature _megatexture_ (for ET:QW) enabled outdoor scenes; 32768^2
      pixels
  - id tech 5: 2010
    - games: rage, doom 4
    - emphasis on making engine easier to use for devs and others
    - id studio: content-creation tools; no more need for external/cmdline tools
    - virtual texturing: 128000^2 pixels; stream on demand
    - dynamically changeable worlds
    - penumbra (soft edges) in shadows using shadow maps (vs sharply defined
      shadows)
    - HDR, depth of field, motion blur, multi-threaded processing
    - opengl, DX9, not DX10
- games
  - quakeworld: quake with networking redone for much better internet play
    (orig for LAN); GPL'd maps
- tools
  - netradiant: q3 map editor; heritage in gtkradiant, q3radiant, QE4 (q2)
- misc
  - rcon: remote console; various protocols include valve's, quakeworld's, etc
  - quakenet: orig for quakeworld players; now general IRC net
  - binary space partitioning (BSP): TODO
    - recursively subdivide space into convex sets by hyperplanes, yielding BSP
      trees
    - used for levels; render quickly while minimizing polygon count per refresh
    - large open areas don't work well
