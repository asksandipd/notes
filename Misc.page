academia

- assistant professor: 5-6 years, then tenure/promote to associate
- associate professor
- (full) professor

standard bodies

- ecma: they submit things to iso
- iso/iec: big kahuna
- ietf: internet standards, rfcs; works with w3c, iso
- w3c: web standards; works with iso
- whatwg: w3c too slow; made html5; w3c agreed to adopt
- iana: IP addrs, AS numbers, media types, IP protos/ports/etc; runs dns root
  and some TLDs; op'd by icann
- icann: iana stuff, TLDs, root servers

- theory folks seem to use single-column articles, probably because math
  lines grow long (as I encountered in my machine learning report) and
  because their articles tend to be much shorter (and thus probably require
  fewer compacting/space-saving measures)

Charles Babbage: first programmer

Ada Lovelace: publisher of first program (Babbage's)

game programming

- heavy emphasis on performance all the way through
  - unlike web app dev, where you just need to make things scalable
  - still use asm, esp. for graphics operations

demoscene

- ultra-compact interactive graphical programs, usu. in asm

MusicBrainz

- used to use a patented technology called TMR but that didn't turn out to be
  scalable (lots of collisions among dissimilar tracks)
- switched to MusicIP analysis technology, also closed-source
- Picard tagger has much lighter-weight "fingerprinting" technology
