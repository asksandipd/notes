# Welcome to Yang's Wiki

This is my collection of notes on computer science, research, programming, and
industry, with a heavy focus on software systems. I wiki-fied this to share the
information through a familiar read/write web interface. This wiki system,
[Gitit](http://gitit.net/), is powered by Git, so I've cloned the repository
[on github](http://github.com/yang/notes).

To see what's here, click on the [All Pages](_index) link at the left.

The wiki has a [site-wide feed](_feed) and per-page feeds (e.g., for the
[Concurrency]() page, use [_feed/Concurrency](_feed/Concurrency)).

Watch your step. This place is really messy.

profile], or [blog].
