- spectral graph theory
  - study of graphs and the characteristic polynomials, evals, and evecs of $A$
    or $L$

- digraph: directed graph

- sparse graph: # edges close to min # edges
- dense graph: # edges close to max # edges

- finite graph: finite # edges and # nodes
- locally finite graph: each node has finite degree

- multigraph: a graph with multiple edges between same node pairs

- spectrum of a graph: spectrum (eigenvalues) of graph's adj mat $A$
  - isomorphic graphs have same spectrum
  - $d$-regular graph is connected iff $\lambda_1 > \lambda-2$
  - $d$-regular graph has largest eval $d$

- laplacian matrix of a graph (of n nodes) $L = D - A$ where
  - $D = diag(d_1, ..., d_n)$, where $d_i$ = degree of node i
  - $A$ = adj mat

- spectral embedding: plotting a graph using some of its spectral eigenvectors
  as coordinates

- spectral gap: difference between largest evals, $\lambda_1 - \lambda_2$

- expander graph: sparse graph with high connectivity
  - name: subsets "expand" quickly
  - standard constraint: $d$-regular
  - expansion parameters: edge expansion, vertex expansion, spectral expansion
    - hard to compute (exponentially many subsets)
    - lower- and upper-bounded by expressions on the gap of the graph
  - many apps involve random walks on expanders
    - markov transition matrix is just proportional to the adj mat
  - applications
    - fault tolerance: networks with guaranteed connectivity (removing random
      edges does not reduce property of an expander by much)
    - more surprisingly: ECCs, PRNGs, crypto hashes, PCP theorem

- $k$-regular graph: each node has degree $k$
  - max degree is an eval

- _clustering coefficient_ of some node is (# links between neighbors / #
  possible); best to refer to wikipedia illustration
  - intuitively: how close a node + neighbors are to being a clique

- complex networks: exhibit non-trivial topological features
  - e.g.:
    - heavy tail in degree distribution
    - high clustering coefficient TODO
    - assortativity: preference for a network's nodes to attach to others that
      are similar or different in some way
    - clustering at many scales
    - hierarchical structure

- scale-free network: describes many "real-world networks"
  - some nodes are highly connected hubs (high degree)
  - most nodes are of low degree
  - degree distribution follows power law
  - structure and dynamics are independent of # nodes
  - preferential attachment
  - fault-tolerance: assuming uniformly random node failures, unlikely that a
    hub fails

- hypergraph: generalization of a graph, where edges can connect any number of
  vertices

- de Bruijn graph: with n dimensions and m symbols, this is a directed graph of
  m^n vertices, one for each length-n sequence of symbols
  - rule for edges is more complicated; captures overlaps between sequences of
    symbols

- butterfly graph: recursive criss-crosses
  - found in fft

- butterfly network: a network that's almost partitioned, connected only by a
  few edges
  - different from butterfly graph

- network theory: application of graph theory to networks, which are graphs
  that represent relations between objects

- network coding: "combining" values to maximize information flow

- Euclidian graph: edge weights = Euclidian distance

- random graph: graph generated by randomly adding edges to a node set
  - there are different random processes used
  - Erdos number: collaborative distance to ("degrees away from") Paul Erdos

- planar graph
  - $O(n)$ to determine planarity
  - sparse: $O(v)$ edges, asymptotically smaller than max ($O(v^2)$)
  - polyhedra can be "unrolled" into planar graphs
- Euler characteristic: number that describes an aspect of a toplogical space's
  shape or structure
- Euler's formula: for finite, connected, planar graphs, $v - e + f = 2$, where
  $f$ is # faces
  - i.e., Euler characteristic is 2
